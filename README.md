# File Oraganiser
Simple Python Script to organise and tidy-up the download folders in windows.
- Just change the path at line_19 of the script to your own path and you are good to go.

## Update: 2022-06-22
I am working on a cron or scheduler for the program and will post the details soon. Till then you can manually use the script.
